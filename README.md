In this project, I have used basic and advanced SQL querying techniques to explore COVID-19 data. The repository showcases my skills in data exploration.

## Data Sources

I have used the COVID-19 data provided by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) for this project. The data is updated regularly and provides a detailed breakdown of COVID-19 cases and deaths at a country and regional level.

I hope that this project will be helpful in understanding the impact of COVID-19 and in devising strategies to mitigate its spread.
